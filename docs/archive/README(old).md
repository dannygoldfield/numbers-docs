## Overview

**Numbers** is an experimental auction system that inscribes numbers, one at a time (1, 2, 3, and so on), onto individual satoshis on Bitcoin. The project is being developed in stages, starting with a demo-ready MVP, followed by Testnet prototypes, and culminating in a public Mainnet launch.

It explores digital ownership, permanence, and value by creating a new asset: the number itself.

1. Real-time auctions with countdown timers.
2. Bitcoin inscriptions for immutable ownership.
3. Modular architecture for scalability and testing.
4. Open-source under MIT license, inviting community contributions.

## Product Roadmap

### MVP: Minimum Viable Product (v0.1.0)

A demo-ready CLI model with six simulated components.

**Components:**

1. Wallet: Simulated wallet connection via user name.
2. Auction: CLI bidding via stdin with 56-second countdown.
3. Inscribe: Simulated inscription with mock txid.
4. Payment: Simulated payment recording.
5. Settle: Simulated winner settlement.
6. Website: Planned but not included in MVP.

**Demo Flow:**

1. Enter simulated wallet name and place a bid to start the auction.
2. At countdown end, select winner and simulate inscription.
3. Save result to `results/inscription_index.json`.

### MVP+: Real Testnet Integration (v0.1.1)

A CLI-only upgrade that connects to Bitcoin Core on Testnet.

**New Features:**

1. Wallet: Generates and lists real Testnet addresses via RPC.
2. Inscribe: Binds a number to a real satpoint using UTXO data.
3. JSON Index: Records number, satpoint, txid, and bidder in flat file.
4. RPC: Uses `bitcoincore-rpc` for real blockchain interaction.

**Purpose:**

Establish end-to-end realism before expanding features. Sets foundation for modularization and future UI.

### Alpha Prototype (v0.2.x)

Adds web interface and payment simulation for user testing.

**Goals:**

1. Real Testnet wallets and bidding
2. Simulated payments and mock settlement
3. Basic web frontend for interaction
4. Stress testing with logging and RPC handling

### Beta Prototype (v0.3.x)

Focuses on performance and multi-user support.

**Goals:**

1. Concurrent bidding (5–10 simulated users)
2. Sub-second latency between bid and feedback
3. Logging of all auction activity
4. Transition from JSON to SQLite index

### Product Launch (v1.0.0)

Public Bitcoin Mainnet release with full functionality.

**Modules:**

1. Wallet: Connect and fund securely
2. Auction: Live web bidding with real-time updates
3. Inscribe: Write numbers to real Mainnet satoshis
4. Payment: Real BTC transfers with confirmations
5. Settle: Secure handoff with full audit trail
6. Website: Public UI for auctions, results, and history

**Infrastructure:**

1. SQLite or Postgres for persistence
2. Server-based RPC and node hosting
3. Monitoring and error recovery
4. Contributor and bidder onboarding guides

## Artwork Description

The number, inscribed as a Bitcoin Ordinal, displays in the user’s system default font, inheriting the native type environment. With minimal styling, it remains a conceptual form universally rendered, locally interpreted.

## 🛠️ Current Requirements for MVP

1. **OS**: macOS (Linux/Windows support planned)
2. **Language**: Rust (v1.67 or later)
3. **Bitcoin**: Bitcoin Core (Testnet mode)
4. **Storage**: \~500 GB for Testnet blockchain

## Setup and Run

1. **Run Bitcoin Core in Testnet mode:**

```bash
bitcoind -testnet -datadir=/path/to/bitcoin-testnet
```

2. **Verify blockchain sync:**

```bash
bitcoin-cli -testnet -rpcuser=Numbers -rpcpassword=auction123 getblockchaininfo
```

3. **Set environment variables:**

```bash
export RPC_URL=http://127.0.0.1:18332
export RPC_USER=Numbers
export RPC_PASS=auction123
```

4. **Clone and run Numbers:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/Numbers.git
cd Numbers
cargo run
```

> **Note**: Requires a local Bitcoin Core node in Testnet mode. Ensure sufficient disk space for the blockchain.
