# GROK NOTES

This document contains answers to Grok system queries for consistent project context and planning.

---

## 1. MVP Testing

The MVP (`main.rs`) has been tested successfully using stdin to simulate bidding during a 56-second auction. Key modules like `Auction` and `Inscribe` are functional in simulation. Wallet, Payment, and Settle are currently placeholders.

**Known gaps:**
- No-bid and simultaneous-bid edge cases need logic handling.
- Simulated bids only—no RPC wallet integration yet.
- No persistent data store beyond basic JSON.

---

## 2. Wallet Integration

Wallet support is minimal in v0.1.0. In Alpha (v0.2.x), we plan to:
- Connect to Bitcoin Core Testnet via RPC
- Generate new addresses and fund them
- Extract UTXO and satpoint data for inscription
- Monitor mempool and confirm payments

**Assistance needed:** secure RPC calls in Rust, error handling, and key management for testnet.

---

## 3. Inscription Simulation

Current inscriptions are mock writes. We're transitioning to real Testnet inscriptions using:
- UTXO and satpoint extraction via RPC
- Custom lightweight index (JSON or SQLite)
- Direct handling of satpoint targeting

**No use of `ord`, no sat rarity or heuristics.** We want transparent, manual control for now.

---

## 4. Performance Metrics (Beta Goals)

In Beta (v0.3.x), our focus is on:
- 5–10 concurrent bidders per auction
- Sub-second bid-to-update latency
- Logging all bids, transitions, and auction states
- Resource monitoring (CPU, memory, I/O)

Simulated users and basic stress testing will be used during QA.

---

## 5. Documentation Roadmap

We plan to expand `README.md` and `WHY.md` with:
- Internal API endpoint documentation:
  - `POST /start`
  - `POST /bid`
  - `GET /status`
  - `POST /inscribe`
- Timeline for phases:
  - MVP (v0.1.0): CLI auction + mock inscribe ✅
  - Alpha (v0.2.x): Testnet RPC + real inscribe
  - Beta (v0.3.x): Live bidder testing + performance focus
  - Mainnet (v1.0.0): Public launch + web interface
- WHY.md clarification:
  - Starting at 1 (not 0) as core philosophy
  - Numbers as ownable artifacts, not tokens
  - No rarity. No gamification. Just clarity.


# GROK: Follow-up Answers to Five Questions

These responses build upon the initial GROKNOTES.md and align with the scoped "MVP+" plan (v0.1.1), which introduces real Bitcoin Testnet functionality while preserving minimal CLI-only structure before Alpha.

---

## 1. MVP Testing – Prioritization

Let’s **prioritize wallet integration first**. Connecting to a real Bitcoin Testnet wallet is essential for validating actual inscriptions and building a trustworthy pipeline. Once that’s working, we can revisit auction edge cases like no-bid or simultaneous-bid resolution logic. These will be addressed as part of v0.2.x (Alpha).

---

## 2. Wallet Integration – RPC Snippet Request

Yes, please provide a **Rust code snippet using the `bitcoincore-rpc` crate** that demonstrates:

* Connecting to Bitcoin Core Testnet via RPC
* Generating a new address (`getnewaddress`)
* Listing unspent outputs (`listunspent`)
* Optional: Funding that address via `sendtoaddress` for manual testing

The snippet will be integrated into `main.rs` as part of **v0.1.1 (MVP+)**, then modularized in Alpha. Secure error handling and clear logging are preferred.

---

## 3. Inscription Simulation – Index Type

We will **start with a lightweight JSON index** for inscriptions in **v0.1.1 (MVP+)**. This keeps the system transparent and easy to inspect.

Example structure:

```json
{
  "number": 17,
  "txid": "abc123...",
  "satpoint": "txid:vout:offset",
  "timestamp": "2025-08-03T15:00:00Z",
  "bidder": "test_btc_address"
}
```

We plan to transition to a SQLite index for querying and performance optimization in **v0.3.x (Beta)**.

---

## 4. Performance Metrics – Stress Testing

Stress testing is planned for **v0.2.x (Alpha)** and **v0.3.x (Beta)**. We’d like to set up a **basic stress test script** (Rust or Python) to simulate multiple bidders. Priorities:

* Simulate 5–10 concurrent bids
* Focus on final 10 seconds of auction
* Log bid timestamp, latency, and result
* CLI-only for now, with optional Tokio or Rayon use

This will guide performance tuning and modular refactoring.

---

## 5. Documentation Roadmap – API & Timeline Draft

Yes, please generate a draft API spec for internal use with endpoints like:

* `POST /start` – Start a new auction
* `POST /bid` – Submit a bid (`number`, `amount`, `bidder`)
* `GET /status` – View current auction state
* `POST /inscribe` – Manually trigger inscription (dev-only)

Update `README.md` with the following roadmap:

* `v0.1.0`: MVP – CLI, simulated logic ✅
* `v0.1.1`: MVP+ – Real Testnet wallet, satpoints, JSON index
* `v0.2.x`: Alpha – Payments, stress testing, minimal web UI
* `v0.3.x`: Beta – Multi-user load testing, finalize SQLite
* `v1.0.0`: Mainnet – Public auctions, secure settlement

Each phase preserves conceptual coherence and prepares for a secure, extensible product launch.

## UI/UX Q&A

Writing prompt process for deep research

1. Do you want examples from active production sites only, or are concept designs (e.g., Dribbble, Behance) also acceptable?
Not only active production sites and nclude concept designs. 

2. Are you specifically looking for mobile-first or desktop-first layouts?
Only mobile.

3. Should the examples lean more toward NFT marketplaces (like Foundation, Zora) or single-item auction dApps?
Lean much more heavily towards single item auction dApps.

4. Any chain or ecosystem you want to prioritize (e.g., Ordinals over Ethereum)?
This will be for the Numbers dApp of course but any ecosystem is fine to research now.

5. Do you want these concepts formatted as static wireframes, interactive prototypes, or narrative walkthroughs (or a mix)? 

6. Should I aim to stay within the color/font/style palette seen in your attached screenshot (warm, VS Code-inspired) for all but the humorous/outrageous ones?

7. Are there any UX behaviors you strongly want to avoid (e.g., modals, infinite scroll, horizontal nav)?

## UI Prompts

Firefly
Concept 1: Professional A minimalist auction app called "Numbers" features a clean, modern interface with a warm, human-centered palette. The background is a soft, gradient orange and blue, evoking a sense of warmth and optimism. A countdown timer is prominently displayed at the top, with a subtle monospaced font and a blinking cursor, adding a touch of tech without being overwhelming. Below, an animated slogan, "What if you could own a number?" appears in a sleek, elegant font. The bid input field is large and easy to type on, with a soft, gradient background that enhances readability. The layout is mobile-friendly, ensuring a comfortable experience for users. ### Concept 2: Humorous/Playful In this version of "Numbers," the app has a playful, whimsical feel. The background is a vibrant, gradient of sunny yellow and sky blue, with a subtle monospaced font and blinking cursor for a tech nod. A countdown timer is displayed with a fun, hand-drawn font, and the animated slogan, "What if you could own a number?" is written in a quirky, cursive style. The bid input field is large and inviting, with a soft, gradient background that feels warm and approachable.
